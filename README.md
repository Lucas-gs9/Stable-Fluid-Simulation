# Stable-Fluid-Simulation
Real-time 2D Fluid Simulation | Implementation of Jos Stam's Stable-Fluids with RGB density field, interactive mouse brush, infinite domain boundary, and configurable force fields (vortex/horizontal/vertical). Jacobi iteration for diffusion/projection with parallel optimization for CPU real-time rendering.
